## ðŸ“‹ Summary
Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device. One can also download TV shows and movies to your iOS, Android, or Windows 10 device and watch without an internet connection. Netflix content varies by region and may change over time. One can watch from a wide variety of award-winning Netflix Originals, TV shows, movies, documentaries, and more. Netflix have data which were released in the past also. Not all the movies and TV shows are released first on Netflix itself The main objective of this project is clustering of Netflix movies and TV shows in optimum number of clusters. This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. Movies and TV shows can be categorized on several factors such as genres, cast and director of movies or TV shows etc.

## ðŸ“– K-Means And Recommender System

I have used a K Means clustering with an optimal value of k=25 for clustering the Text Based Columns. The value of k was evaluated using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

## ðŸ“‹ Execution Instruction

The order of execution of the colab notebook is as follows:



 ### 1. [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering](https://github.com/Amolrakhunde/Netflix-Movies-And-TV-Shows-Clustering/blob/main/Netflix_Movies_And_TV_Shows_Clusterig_Amol.ipynb) 
- First, click on the open in colab button present on the top center of the notebook.

### 2. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- Downlaod the dataset from kaggle through provided link.Then, connect to the runtime and execute the cell to mount the drive or upload the data file to the current runtime.

### 3. File Path
- Finally, delete the path in the dataset loading cell and replace it with the path of your current data file. Run each cell to see the output below it.
